# Docker lifecycle coordination

The Docker provider serializes resource creation, command admission, one-shot
admission, and lifecycle mutations through a daemon-scoped claim. Independent
provider instances that connect to the same daemon use the same claim. Existing
library calls and protocol v2 use this implementation; it does not declare that
the Docker provider implements the entire next API.

The claim is an unstarted container with a unique Docker name. It carries
`sh.sandbox-driver.fence` and `sh.sandbox-driver.fence-operation` labels and is
excluded from sandbox inventory. Creation acquires a claim before exposing the
primary container. The primary's `sh.sandbox-driver.fence-name` label records
that claim name for subsequent clients. Older sandboxes without this label use
the canonical container ID to identify their claim.

An admitted exec releases its claim after Docker starts the attached execution;
the command itself can then run concurrently with other commands. One-shots
release admission after their container has started and carry the sandbox ID
for later discovery. Image preparation precedes one-shot admission. A prepared
one-shot must still acquire the claim and observe a running sandbox before it
can start.

Stop holds the claim while removing one-shots, stopping the primary container,
and stopping its services. It inspects the primary and services to confirm they
are no longer running; missing or still-running state returns `fence_leaked`
and retains the claim. Start, exec, one-shot admission, pause, resume, and
delete cannot overtake that drain. A competing lifecycle claim is refused as a
legacy `ProviderError` with code `busy`. Short concurrent execution admissions
can wait up to five seconds for one another. Describe and inventory remain
available while a claim is held.

## Failure and reconciliation

A completed daemon refusal releases the claim so the application can decide
whether to retry. A transport failure, deadline, or dropped caller retains it:
the provider cannot establish that the remote mutation finished. There is no
lease expiry, automatic takeover, or mutation replay. The error uses code
`transport`, with `outcome: unknown` and the known claim container ID or name in
`detail` (or the sandbox ID if acquisition did not reveal the claim). A cancelled future cannot return an error, so the labels provide the
reconciliation record.

The claim must not be removed merely because its creator disconnected or a
period of time passed. An operator or application recovery procedure must first
establish that the original request can no longer change the sandbox and that
any required termination or cleanup is complete. Different clients, including
older provider versions and direct Docker commands, must not bypass this
coordination while managed work is active. The mechanism coordinates cooperating
provider clients; it is not an authorization boundary against Docker admins.

Each daemon call that acquires, discovers, or releases a claim has a 60-second
bound. Execution admission, stop, pause, resume, and delete have a 60-second
operation bound; create and start have a six-minute bound to allow the existing
service readiness budget. A failure to confirm claim release is an error even if
the workload mutation completed.

A failed create attempts dependent cleanup before removing the primary, with a
30-second cleanup budget. Unconfirmed cleanup uses `incomplete_cleanup` and
serializes the shared contract's `IncompleteCleanup` error in `detail`, including
resource identifiers whose removal remains unconfirmed. A cleanup transport
failure also retains the claim and includes it in the remaining resources.
Creation failures whose cleanup succeeds preserve their original error.

## Verification and migration scope

The real-daemon fence tests are explicit integration tests:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p sandbox-driver-docker --test fence -- --ignored
```

They exercise independent provider clients, stop versus exec/one-shots/services,
start during draining, cancelled ownership, and attachment during creation.
The lifecycle failure-injection tests cover release failure, uncertain admission,
retained ownership after primary removal, and incomplete creation cleanup.

Portable workload translation, namespace and descriptor reporting, next-API
provider integration, and the new cross-provider conformance harness are separate
migration work. Passing the legacy suite or these focused tests is not evidence
that Docker passes that full contract.
