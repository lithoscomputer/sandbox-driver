# sandbox-driver

Sandbox providers for managing sandboxes, snapshots, and volumes. Every
provider implements one trait family from `sandbox-driver`, and an
application reaches it in one of two supported ways:

- **In-process.** The application links a bundled provider library
  (`sandbox-driver-host`, `sandbox-driver-docker`, `sandbox-driver-daytona`)
  and constructs the provider directly. Fabro embeds the bundled providers
  this way.
- **JSON-RPC plugin.** The application launches a provider executable and
  speaks the protocol in `sandbox-driver-protocol`. Third-party providers,
  and any bundled provider an operator prefers to run out of process, take
  this path. Petri uses it for every provider.

Both paths present the same `SandboxProvider` and `Sandbox` traits, so
application code is written once. The difference is confined to
construction and to the wire mask in `docs/protocol.md` §5.

| Crate | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sandbox-driver` | Core traits, types, exec-derived facets, wait/probe helpers |
| `sandbox-driver-host` | Host executable and internal implementation — directories, no isolation |
| `sandbox-driver-docker` | Docker executable and internal implementation — containers with a workspace volume, one-shot containers, sidecars, image pulls |
| `sandbox-driver-docker-config` | The Docker provider's `provider_config` as plain Serde types, for hosts on the wire |
| `sandbox-driver-daytona` | Daytona executable and internal implementation — cloud VMs, nested Docker, snapshots, volumes |
| `sandbox-driver-daytona-config` | Typed Daytona and nested Docker configuration for plugin clients |
| `sandbox-driver-protocol` | JSON-RPC plugin protocol (version 2, with per-operation data channels): serve any provider, adapt any plugin |
| `sandbox-driver-conformance` | Black-box conformance suite every provider must pass |
| `sandbox-driver-testing` | Scripted in-memory sandbox and provider doubles for consumers' unit tests |
| `sandbox-driver-cli` | `lithos-sandbox` command for provider diagnostics and sandbox operations |

Each provider package is a library with a supported public API for in-process
embedding, and also builds a plugin executable with the same name as the
package. The Docker library is reused inside Daytona for nested Docker.
`lithos-sandbox` reaches every provider through JSON-RPC so it exercises the
same path a third-party plugin does.

Host and Docker pass conformance locally (Docker needs a daemon), in
process and served over the plugin wire; the Daytona suite runs live with
`DAYTONA_API_KEY` set.

See `docs/design.md` for the interface design
and `docs/protocol.md` for the normative plugin wire protocol.

## Nested Docker on Daytona

Daytona can own a nested job container, sidecars, and one-shot action containers.
Use `DaytonaProviderConfig` from `sandbox-driver-daytona-config`. The runner
snapshot must include `start-docker`, the Docker CLI, and Python 3. Nested
operations use Daytona's native process and file APIs. The outer sandbox
owns the lifecycle of all nested resources.
See [the design](docs/design.md#nested-docker-on-daytona) for configuration and
restart behavior.

Docker command construction and binary file transfers have local tests. The hosted integration remains an
explicit live gate:

```sh
# Set DAYTONA_API_KEY and SANDBOX_DRIVER_DAYTONA_DIND_SNAPSHOT first.
cargo nextest run --locked -p sandbox-driver-daytona --test nested_docker --run-ignored only
```

## CLI

Build the `lithos-sandbox` command and inspect the available operations:

```sh
mise run dev
export SANDBOX_DRIVER_PLUGIN_DEV=1
export PATH="$PWD/target/debug:$PATH"
target/debug/lithos-sandbox --help
```

Host plugins can recover across restarts on Linux and macOS. Set
`SANDBOX_DRIVER_HOST_REGISTRY` in an explicitly configured plugin environment
to a caller-owned directory. Stop fences sandbox process groups;
recovery never signals saved process ids. Named workspaces remain designated
unless `workspace_ownership: Managed` explicitly transfers their creation and
deletion to the provider. Managed workspaces are deleted only after work stops.

The development opt-in above allows local binaries without checksum pins.
For installed providers, configure checksum pins as described in
[the CLI guide](docs/cli.md#provider-executables).

Run a command in a temporary Host sandbox:

```sh
lithos-sandbox --provider host sandbox run --workspace "$PWD" -- \
  bash -lc 'cargo test'
```

Use Docker for persistent sandbox operations:

```sh
id=$(lithos-sandbox --provider docker --output id sandbox create \
  --image ubuntu:24.04)
lithos-sandbox --provider docker sandbox exec "$id" -- uname -a
lithos-sandbox --provider docker sandbox delete "$id"
```

See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) for provider profiles, plugin configuration,
creation specifications, output formats, and exit behavior.

## Diagnostics

The library crates emit `tracing` spans and events. Applications choose
the subscriber and output destination. Operation fields include provider
kinds, resource IDs, states, attempts, counts, and durations. They do not
include commands, environment values, tokens, URLs, file paths, request
bodies, or command output.

The plugin executables configure a stderr subscriber. They use `RUST_LOG`
when set and default to `info`. Protocol messages remain on stdout.

## Setup

Install the locked tools and prepare the repository:

```sh
mise trust
mise install --locked --jobs=1
mise run setup
```

Use the repository tasks for development and verification:

```sh
mise run dev
mise run test
mise run check
```

See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for the complete development workflow.

Routine and nightly checks run on macOS arm64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64.
A pushed `v*` tag builds one archive per plugin executable for the same three
platforms, with a checksum of each archive and of each executable, and
creates a draft GitHub release.
