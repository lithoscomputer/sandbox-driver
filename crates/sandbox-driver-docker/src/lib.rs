//! Docker container sandbox provider.
//!
//! A supported library for in-process embedding, and the implementation
//! behind the same-named plugin executable. An application either links
//! this crate and constructs the provider directly, or launches the
//! executable and reaches it through `sandbox-driver-protocol`. Both
//! present the same trait family.
//!
//! Containers created from OCI images, with kernel-sharing container
//! isolation (`Isolation::Container`). The Docker socket is
//! host-root-equivalent, so this provider is host-trusted by definition.
//!
//! The container's data plane is hybrid: file content moves through
//! the daemon's archive API (streamed reads that stop at the requested
//! range, writes that carry their missing parents, both working on a
//! stopped container), while metadata operations stay exec-derived — so
//! `Capabilities::fs` still reports `native: false`. Every image must
//! provide `/bin/sh`, `env`, and `setsid` for the exec wrapper (kill
//! semantics need a separate session, and `env` carries the command's
//! environment past the shell; an image without either fails every exec
//! with a clear message). The exec-derived facets are Bash scripts, so an
//! image that serves them must also provide `bash` on `PATH` and a Linux
//! userland with `stat`, `find`, and `base64`. Because Docker advertises
//! the normalized Search, Git, and background-services facets, the image
//! must also provide the commands documented by [`sandbox_driver::Search`]
//! and [`sandbox_driver::Services`], plus `git`, on `PATH`. A program that
//! needs none of that — Petri's step runner, which execs, reads and writes
//! files, and runs one-shot containers — runs on any Linux image with a
//! POSIX userland, Alpine included.
//!
//! # The workspace
//!
//! The sandbox owns its workspace: the working directory is a Docker
//! volume created with the container and removed with it, unless the
//! caller's `provider_config.binds` mounts a host directory there. Every
//! [`sandbox_driver::OneShot`] container the sandbox runs mounts the same
//! volume at the same path and joins the sandbox container's network
//! namespace, so it sees the workspace, the sidecars, and the daemon host
//! exactly as the sandbox does. `stop` and `delete` end the sandbox's
//! one-shot containers first.
//!
//! # Runtime behavior
//!
//! Async on Tokio; the caller owns the runtime. Spawned tasks: stream
//! demux and stdin writers scoped to a running exec, and kill requests
//! on cancellation that run from `/` and fail loudly when the stop
//! cannot be requested. Docker itself is the
//! sandbox registry — handles re-attach by container id across process
//! restarts.
