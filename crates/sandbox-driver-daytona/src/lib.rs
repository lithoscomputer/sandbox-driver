//! Daytona cloud sandbox provider.
//!
//! A supported library for in-process embedding, and the implementation
//! behind the same-named plugin executable. An application either links
//! this crate and constructs the provider directly, or launches the
//! executable and reaches it through `sandbox-driver-protocol`. Both
//! present the same trait family.
//!
//! VM-backed sandboxes (`Isolation::Vm`) through the Daytona control
//! plane and per-sandbox toolbox daemon, with snapshots and volumes as
//! first-class services and preview-URL/SSH access facets.
//!
//! Lifecycle: archive, undelete (Daytona's "recover" — restore
//! within 24 hours of deletion), refresh-activity, all five timers (TTL
//! and auto-pause included), labels, runtime network updates, and — on
//! VM sandbox classes, narrowed per sandbox — pause/resume, fork, and
//! sandbox-to-snapshot with filesystem and live-process-state modes. The
//! PTY facet rides the toolbox
//! WebSocket; `spawn_stdio` rides command sessions and is UTF-8-only
//! (see the stdio module). The outbound proxy is `provider_config`
//! (`{"outbound_proxy_url": …}`), composing with a domain allow list as
//! upstream intends rather than competing as a network policy. Plain execs run
//! buffered through the toolbox's one-shot endpoint; a sink or stop token
//! routes through a command session, which streams logs live with
//! separated stdout/stderr, kills on stop/timeout by deleting the
//! session, and preserves partial output on timeout. Stdin is delivered
//! through a temp-file redirection inside the sandbox on both paths.
//! Both exec paths encode output before it reaches the toolbox and decode
//! it before delivery, preserving arbitrary bytes and separate streams.
//! Git follows Fabro's hybrid path: clone uses the native toolbox API;
//! worktree and remote operations use the shared exec-derived implementation.
//! Daytona derives Search and background-service management through exec.
//! Snapshots used with these facets must therefore provide the commands
//! documented by [`sandbox_driver::Search`] and [`sandbox_driver::Services`],
//! plus `git`, on `PATH`.
//! Resize remains in the normalized interface, but the current hosted
//! Daytona API and official SDK do not expose a working resize route, so
//! this provider does not declare it.
//!
//! # Lifecycle timers
//!
//! Unset timers inherit Daytona's server defaults — notably auto-stop
//! after **15 idle minutes**, which is shorter than a single long
//! inference call. Callers that run long commands should set
//! `timers.auto_stop_after_idle` explicitly. `Duration::ZERO` is the
//! explicit "never", encoded per timer: wire `0` disables auto-stop;
//! auto-delete crosses as `-1` (its wire `0` means delete immediately
//! on stop and is reserved for the ephemeral flag); auto-archive
//! crosses as `0`, which Daytona reads as "the maximum interval" — the
//! closest the API comes to disabling it.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! [`DaytonaProvider::connect`] uses the SDK's environment configuration:
//! `DAYTONA_API_KEY` (or `DAYTONA_JWT_TOKEN` + `DAYTONA_ORGANIZATION_ID`),
//! optional `DAYTONA_API_URL` and `DAYTONA_TARGET`.
//! [`DaytonaProvider::connect_with_config`] accepts the same values explicitly
//! and falls back to the environment for anything left unset.
//! [`DaytonaProvider::connect_explicit`] never reads the environment, so an
//! embedding application that resolves credentials itself can be sure the
//! worker's environment cannot substitute for them.
